prompt.ipynd has all the necessary code changes to depict if a coupon will be accepted or not

Analyzing the Bar data

1. Only 40% of the bar coupons were accepted
2. For people who went to bar 3 or fewer times in a month, the accpetance ratio was 36.92%
3. For people who went to bar more than 4 times, the acceptance ratio was 76.5%
4a.Add another criteria, people who visited bar atleast once and were atleast 25 years old, the acceptance ratio was 69%   
4b.If all ages were considered, the acceptance ratio dropped down to 49%
5. For people who went to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than 
   farming, fishing, or forestry, the acceptance rate was upto 71%

So basically, the strategy for folks to accept BAR coupons was
1. Ensure that the people went to BAr atleast one time - more the merrier
2. Age group of over 25
3. No kids as passengers

An analysis was done on restaurant coupons(<20) too


1. Cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K - Acceptance rate is around 70%
2. Cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 25K - 63%, so numbers went down
3. Coupontype Restaurant(<20) more than 4 times a month - lets have no limit on the income - around 72.83%
4. coupontype Restaurant(<20) more than 4 times a month - lets have income is >50K but less than 75K - around 77%

So target people around the income range 50-75K to maximize the restaurant coupons to be accepted
